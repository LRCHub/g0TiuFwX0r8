Well today I feel like I'm on fire
She had a way to a hearts desire
And I've never done anything like we did that night
Well I noticed her stood at the bar
I thought are they great boobs of a wonder bra
I asked her name and she said Jennifer

Well Q said its true
MEN... she's had a few
I said I Knew
But practice makes perfect Q

This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This girl is somebody else's girl

Well the things she wanted me to do
I didn't think that I ought to
But I had a drink I had a few
So I just carried on
When we woke up the next day
Well she rolled to me and I rolled away
And I've still done nothing like we did that night

Well Q said its true
MEN... she's had a few
I said I Knew
But practice makes perfect Q

This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This girl is somebody else's girl

This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This girl is somebody else's whoa/world!

This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This girl is somebody else's girl

This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This Girl (she) isn't my girlfriend
This girl is somebody else's whoa/world!
