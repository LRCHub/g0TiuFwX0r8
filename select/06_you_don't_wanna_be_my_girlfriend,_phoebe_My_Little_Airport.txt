You don't wanna be my girlfriend, Phoebe.
You just wanna show your beauty.
Oh my Phoebe, can you see that I'm crying?
All the boys think that you are the best.
All the eyes are just looking at your breast.
Oh my Phoebe, you just wanna show your beauty.
You don't wanna kiss me.
You just wanna show your beauty.
You don't wanna know me.
You know you're not just a love song to me.
You've ever sent your photos to me.
Watching your face is an interesting journey.
Oh my Phoebe, I wanna tell you my little story.
Can you talk to me when I'm lonely?
Can we talk not only when you're lonely?
I know you Phoebe.
I think I trend to know you completely.
You don't wanna kiss me.
You just wanna show your beauty.
You don't wanna know me.
You will never send all your love to me.
So please don't say 'may be we may meet one day'.
This sentence could not last more than one day.
Cos you know I'm not the only one be missed by you as same as I don't only miss you.
