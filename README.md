Hey Hey you you I don't like your girlfriend
No Way No Way I think you need a new one
Hey Hey you you I could be your girlfriend
Hey Hey you you I know that you like me
No Way No Way No it's not a secret
Hey Hey you you I want to be your girlfriend
You're so fine I want you mine
You're so delicious
I think about you all the time
You're so addictive
Don't you know
what I can do to make you feel alright
Don't pretend I think you know
I'm damn precious
And hell yeah I'm the motherf___ing princess
I can tell you like me too
and you know I'm right
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about
Hey Hey you you I don't like your girlfriend
No Way No Way I think you need a new one
Hey Hey you you I could be your girlfriend
Hey Hey you you I know that you like me
No Way No Way No it's not a secret
Hey Hey you you I want to be your girlfriend
I can see the way I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away
I know you think of me
I know you talk about me
all the time again and again
So come over here
and tell me what I want to hear
Better yet make the girlfriend disappear
I don't want to hear
you say her name ever again
She's like so whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now
And that's what everyone's talking about
Hey Hey you you I don't like your girlfriend
No Way No Way I think you need a new one
Hey Hey you you I could be your girlfriend
Hey Hey you you I know that you like me
No Way No Way No it's not a secret
Hey Hey you you I want to be your girlfriend
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
Cause I can cause I can do it better
There's no other so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid what the hell were you thinking
In a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
Cause I can cause I can do it better
There's no other so when's it gonna sink in
She's so stupid what the hell were you thinking
Hey Hey you you I don't like your girlfriend
No Way No Way I think you need a new one
Hey Hey you you I could be your girlfriend
No way No way
Hey Hey you you I know that you like me
No Way No Way No it's not a secret
Hey Hey you you I want to be your girlfriend
No way No way
Hey Hey you you I don't like your girlfriend
No Way No Way I think you need a new one
Hey Hey you you I could be your girlfriend
No way No way
Hey Hey you you I know that you like me
No Way No Way No it's not a secret
Hey Hey you you I want to be your girlfriend
No way No way.....
